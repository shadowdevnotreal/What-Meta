# What-Meta, What Meta?
Automated Text Redaction and Meta Data Removal Tool

## This is a work in progress but it is close to completion.
The tool will open a GUI window and allow you to import a document.
1. Export it back out.
2. Perform OCR and some other secret things.
3. Import the file back in.
4. Remove metada data.
5. Export back out.

## This was an idea that came to me after speaking with a grey hat who worked with keeping journalists and reporters safe.
